# Properties

It’s good practice to divide up your application into multiple components and split them across different files. As your application becomes larger, this quickly becomes essential. For these components to be able to communicate with each other, components have properties – these are values which parent components pass to child components.

A component's properties should be defined using a separate struct which derives `Properties` and `Clone` traits.

> The `Properties` trait requires that the `Clone` trait is implemented for all types for which `Properties` is derived.

> It is common for this struct to be named `Props`

Properties may be defined as:

- optional and initialized with Rust default value
- optional and initialized with component default value
- mandatory, the parent must define a value for the attribute

```rust
use yew::prelude::*;

pub struct UseOfPropertyComponent {
    link: ComponentLink<Self>,
    props: Props,
    name: String,
    show_message: bool,
}

pub enum Msg {
    Click,
}

#[derive(Properties, Clone, PartialEq)]
pub struct Props{
    pub name: String,
}

impl Component for UseOfPropertyComponent {
    type Message = Msg;
    type Properties = Props;

    fn create(props: Self::Properties, link: ComponentLink<Self>) -> Self {
        Self {
            link,
            props: props.clone(),
            name: props.name.into(),
            show_message: false,
        }
    }

    fn update(&mut self, msg: Self::Message) -> ShouldRender {
        match msg {
            Msg::Click => self.show_message = true,
        }
        true
    }

    fn change(&mut self, props: Self::Properties) -> ShouldRender {
        if self.props != props {
            self.props = props;
            true
        } else {
            false
        }
    }

    fn view(&self) -> Html {
        if !self.show_message {
            html! {
                <button onclick=self.link.callback( |_| Msg::Click )>{"Click here!"}</button>
            }
        } else {
            html! {
                <h1>{format!("Hello {}",self.name)}</h1>
            }
        }
    }
}

```

In order to use this component you have to:

```html
// ...
    <div class="full-height">
        {"In this example we pass the name as parameter of the Yew component."}
        <UseOfPropertyComponent name="Clark"/>
    </div>
// ...

```

## Defining the properties struct

```rust
// ...
#[derive(Properties, Clone, PartialEq)]
pub struct Props{
    pub name: String,
}
// ...

```

## Attaching the properties to the state

```rust
// ...
pub struct UseOfPropertyComponent {
    link: ComponentLink<Self>,
    props: Props,
    name: String,
    show_message: bool,
}
// ...
```

## Initializing the properties

```rust
// ...
    fn create(props: Self::Properties, link: ComponentLink<Self>) -> Self {
        Self {
            link,
            props: props.clone(),
            name: props.name.into(),
            show_message: false,
        }
    }
// ...
```

> Here, to simply extend the previous example, we clone the value of the `props` argument. It may not be needed in your code

## Defining property attributes

### Optional property

Property can be defined optional just adding `#[prop_or_default]` on the property. In that case the property value will be initialized by the default Rust type value.

```rust
// ...
#[derive(Properties, Clone, PartialEq)]
pub struct Props{
    #[prop_or_default]
    pub name: String,
}
// ...

```

In that case we will just say "Hello" ;-)

### Optional property with component default value

A property can be defined as an optional property. In this case, it becomes necessary to define a default component value. Yew will automatically use this value if it is not provided when the component is initialized. Such properties should be annotated with the #[prop_or_(default_value)] attribute where default_value specifies the value which Yew should use.

```rust
// ...
#[derive(Properties, Clone, PartialEq)]
pub struct Props{
    #[prop_or("Clark by default".to_string())]
    pub name: String,
}
// ...
```

In that case we will say "Hello Clark by default" ;-)

### Mandatory property

If no attribute is defined the property will be "mandatory". So, if the property is omitted a compilation error is raised. The error looks like:

> no method named `build` found for struct `components::comp4::PropsBuilder<...PropsBuilderStep_missing_required_prop_name>` in the current scope
> method not found in `...::PropsBuilder<...PropsBuilderStep_missing_required_prop_name>`rustc(E0599)
comp4.rs(14, 10): method `build` not found for this`

## Optimizing rendering in the `change` method

In order to avoid unecessary rendering it's possible to compare the mutation of the `props` bag in the `change` method.
This optimization imply to derive `PartialEq` for the `Props` struct to easily compare the `props` bag passed as argument of the method and the one in the internal state of the component.

```rust
// ...
     fn change(&mut self, props: Self::Properties) -> ShouldRender {
         if self.props != props {
             self.props = props;
             true
         } else {
             false
         }
     }
// ...

```

## Memory/speed overhead of using Properties

In `Component::view`, you take a reference to the component's state, and use that to create `Html`. Properties, however, are owned values. This means that in order to create them and pass them to child components, we need to take ownership of the references provided in the `view` function. This is done by implicitly cloning the references as they are passed to components in order to get owned values.

This means that each component has its own distinct copy of the state passed down from its parent, and that whenever you re-render a component, the props for all child components of the re-rendering component will have to be cloned.

The implication of this is if you would otherwise be passing _huge_ amounts of data down as props \(Strings that are 10s of kilobytes in size\), you may want to consider turning your child component into a function which returns `Html` that the parent calls, as this means that data does not have to be cloned.

If you won't need to modify the data passed down through props you can wrap it in an `Rc` so that only a reference-counted pointer to the data is cloned, instead of the actual data itself.

### Example

```rust
use std::rc::Rc;
use yew::Properties;

#[derive(Clone, PartialEq)]
pub enum LinkColor {
    Blue,
    Red,
    Green,
    Black,
    Purple,
}

impl Default for LinkColor {
    fn default() -> Self {
        // The link color will be blue unless otherwise specified.
        LinkColor::Blue
    }
}

#[derive(Properties, Clone, PartialEq)]
pub struct LinkProps {
    /// The link must have a target.
    href: String,
    /// If the link text is huge, this will make copying the string much cheaper.
    /// This isn't usually recommended unless performance is known to be a problem.
    text: Rc<String>,
    /// Color of the link.
    #[prop_or_default]
    color: LinkColor,
    /// The view function will not specify a size if this is None.
    #[prop_or_default]
    size: Option<u32>,
    /// When the view function doesn't specify active, it defaults to true.
    #[prop_or(true)]
    active: bool,
}
```
